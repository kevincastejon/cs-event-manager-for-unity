# EventManager for Unity

### EventManager package encapsulates the delegate system into an event flow similar to the Javascript event system.
### These are main advantages:

- No delegate to declare
- Callback any method that accept an Event (or custom inherited class) object as parameter.
- The events can be dispatched without throwing exception even if no listeners are registered
- Extends easily base class Event to add properties suiting your needs
